HIIIIIIII

There are a couple things you need to run this on your own pc
first of them being Visual Studio Code.

Once you've installed visual studio code,
you'll need to look on the left side and look for the extensions marketplace.
It's a little square button with a corner off to the side a little bit.

You'll need two different extensions, first one is Live server, and the second one is live sass compiler.
Once these are added to your VSC, open the files from github in VSC. On the bottom header, you'll see "watch sass," and "go live," press these and boonks website _should_ be running on your computer (:
